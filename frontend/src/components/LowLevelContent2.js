                        Looking at the following table, the top column represents decimal numbers that represent the value of each binary column.
                        If there is a <b>1</b> in the column, that means your decimal number is made up of the number at the top of that column! If there is a <b>0</b> then that means
                        you don't include that number in your decimal number.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So let's make the number 13!
