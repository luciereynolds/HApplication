                    <p>Boolean data types are very straightforward.</p>
                    <p>A Boolean data type is simply something that only has two possible values, <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.</p>
                    <p>The computer will store true as a 1 and false as a 0.</p>
                    <p>Programmers sometimes use Boolean to represent on/off and yes/no.</p>
